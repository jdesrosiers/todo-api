TODO API
========

The TODO API was created to showcase a Hypermedia API.

Development
------------

This API is built using the Resourceful framework.

* `php -S localhost:8000 index.php` - Run the server

### Tests

What, no tests?! This is sacrilege!

Resourceful allows us to declaratively define an API with almost no code. Until
there is need for actual code, we will put off setting up a test framework.
